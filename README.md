This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and weak references.  The bug occurs when an observer, holding a weak reference to the observed object, attempts to access the observed object after it has been deallocated. This can lead to unexpected crashes. The solution provides a robust approach to handling KVO with weak references to prevent such issues.
